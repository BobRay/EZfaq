EZfaq Extra for MODx Revolution
===============================


**Author:** [Bob Ray](http://bobsguides.com) (based on an idea from SorenG and JavaScript code from DynamicDrive.com)

Thanks to MODx user Sinbad for information on using Flash and Lightbox with EZfaq.

EZfaq allows you to create and display a functional FAQ page. Only the questions are shown until a user clicks on a question, then that question is expanded. A number of options control the actions of the page.

Documentation is available at [Bob's Guides](http://bobsguides.com/ezfaq-tutorial.html)

See a demo at [Bob's Guides Newbie FAQ](http://bobsguides.com/modx-newbie-faq.html)
